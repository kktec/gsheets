kktec/gsheets is based on code forked from andresteingress/gsheets and is a Groovy DSL wrapper over Apache POI.

The original code, ExcelFile, does not support xml spreadsheets and is provided as a convenience.

0.3 Includes basic grid parsing functionality for declaratively reading spreadsheets. 
It assumes a simple grid on the first worksheet originating at rowIndex 0 and columnIndex 0.

Plans as of 2013-07 include enhanced parsing with error reporting and integration tests, additional spreadsheet building features, and better documentation.

Check the tests for more complete examples of usage. There are main methods on the tests that can be used to demonstrate building and parsing spreadsheets.



A simple example of building a Workbook with a Sheet with 1 header row and 3 data rows of 4 columns:

Workbook workbook = builder.workbook {
	workbook {
		def fmt = new SimpleDateFormat('yyyy-MM-dd', Locale.default)
		sheet('sheet 1') {
			row('Name', 'Date', 'Count', 'Value', 'Active')
			row('a', fmt.parse('2012-09-12'), 69, 12.34, true)
			row('b', fmt.parse('2012-09-13'), 666, 43.21, false)
		}
	}	
}

File file = new File(name)
if (!file.exists()) {
	file.createNewFile()
}
OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(file)
workbook.write out
out.close()




A simple example of a parsing Closure that pulls in all physically existing rows, disregarding header rows, with columns of various simple types as a List of Maps:

FileInputStream ins = new FileInputStream('demo.xlsx')
Workbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(ins)
WorkbookParser parser = new WorkbookParser(workbook)
List data = parser.grid {
    headerRows 1
	columns name: String, date: Date, count: Integer, value: BigDecimal, active: Boolean
}
